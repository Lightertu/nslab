Pervasive Computing (Ubiquitous Computing): embedding microprocessors in everyday objects so they can communicate infomation.

Why internet of things?
-----------------------
Net profit for internet economy in next decade is $14.4 trillion.

Five main drivers of IoT economy:
    > Asset use: Iot reduces selling and administrative expense and 
      cost of goods by improving business process execution and capital
      efficiency.
    > Employee productivity: more productive man-hours.
    > Supply chain: eliminating waste and improving process efficiencies
    > Customer experience: creating customer life-time value and grows 
      market share by adding more customers.
    > Innovation (less effort on marketing): increase return on R&D
      investments, reduces time to market, creates additional revenue 
      streams from new business models and opportunities.

Scope of IoTs
-------------
ITU-T gives the following definitions
    > IoT:
    > Things: object capable of being identified na dintegrated into
      communication networks
    > Device: mandatory capability of communication and optional
      capabilities of sensing, actuation, data capture, data storage,
      and data processing.

Other Definitions:
    > contains a micro-controller to provide intellgence.
    > contains sensor(s)
    > Provide means of communication 
    > be able to identified (id tag)

Challenges:
    > energy resource constrain
    > frequent data exchange over loss networks
    > existing internet protocols are not optimal in this case
    > mis-match between data generating rate and few data storage
      locations with slow data update rate.

Two efforts developing overall frameworks

ITU-T Reference Model
=====================
    > An IoT Architecture is needed
        -> provides a checklist of evaluation
        -> provides guidance to developers
        -> serve as a framework for standardization

    > it details the physical componenets of IoT ecosystem
    > IoT is not a network of physical things, it is a network of devices that interacts with physical things

    > Terminologies:
        -> Communication Network: infrastructure network connects devices and apps
        -> Thing: an object that is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks
        -> Device: Mandatory capability of communication and optional capabilities of sensing.
        -> Data-carrying Device: A device attached to a physical things to indirectedly connect the physical thing (RFID tags)
        -> Data-capturing Device: Reader or writer that interacts with physical things, interaction happen indirectly via data carrying devices
        -> Data carrier: Battery free data carrying objects attacjed to a physical thing can provide information to a suiable data capturing
           device. like (QR code)
        -> Sensoring device: sensor
        -> General Device: embedded processing and communication capabilities. like smartphones
        -> Gateway: A unit in the Iot that interconnects the device with the communication networks as a protocol translator
            * support a variety of device access technologies (protocal translation)
            * supports necessary netwokring technologies for both local and wide-area networking (protocal translation)
            * supports interaction with applications, provides higher-level functionaloty on behalf of IoT devices
        
        
    > technologies between data carrying / capturing / carrier devices:
        -> Radio Frequency (RFID)
        -> Infrared (Infrared badges)
        -> Optical (Bar code and QR code)
        -> Galvanic Driving

    > layers
        -> Application layer
            * all apps interact with IoT devices
        -> Service Support and Application support layer
            * capabilities application use such as common data processing 
        -> Network layer
            * interconnection of devices and gateways 
            * Transport of IoT service and application specific information
        -> Device layer
        -> Management Capabilities Layer
            * traditional network oriented management functions 
            * Device Management
            * Local Netowkr Topology Management
            * Traffic and Congestion Management 

        -> Security Capabilities Layer
            * generic security capabilities that are independent of applications
            
            * Application layer
            * Network layer
            * Device layer
