Pervasive Computing (Ubiquitous Computing): embedding microprocessors in everyday objects so they can communicate infomation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why internet of things?
-----------------------
Net profit for internet economy in next decade is $14.4 trillion.

Five main drivers of IoT economy:
    > Asset use: Iot reduces selling and administrative expense and 
      cost of goods by improving business process execution and capital
      efficiency.
    > Employee productivity: more productive man-hours.
    > Supply chain: eliminating waste and improving process efficiencies
    > Customer experience: creating customer life-time value and grows 
      market share by adding more customers.
    > Innovation (less effort on marketing): increase return on R&D
      investments, reduces time to market, creates additional revenue 
      streams from new business models and opportunities.

Scope of IoTs
-------------
ITU-T gives the following definitions
    > IoT:
    > Things: object capable of being identified na dintegrated into
      communication networks
    > Device: mandatory capability of communication and optional
      capabilities of sensing, actuation, data capture, data storage,
      and data processing.

Other Definitions:
    > contains a micro-controller to provide intellgence.
    > contains sensor(s)
    > Provide means of communication 
    > be able to identified (id tag)

Challenges:
    > energy resource constrain
    > frequent data exchange over loss networks
    > existing internet protocols are not optimal in this case
    > mis-match between data generating rate and few data storage
      locations with slow data update rate.
