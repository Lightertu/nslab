How do routers forward packets?
    forwarding: how to handle packets when they arrive
    routing : computing all the path in a network so routers know where to
                forward

Goal of network layer:
    > Scale to large networks
    > Support diverse technologies
    > Use link bandwidth well


IP Forwarding:
    > All IP address on one network belong to the same prefix.
    > Nodes use forwarding table that lists the next hop for IP prefixes

Longest Matching Prefix:
    > Prefixes in the table might overlap
    > Longest matching prefix forwarding rule:
        -> for each packets, find the longest prefix that contains the
           destination address, the most specific entry
        -> Forward the packet to the next hop router for that prefix

Host/Router Distinction:
    In the Internet:
        -> routers do the routing, know which way of all destinations
        -> Hosts send remote traffic to nearest router

Host Forwarding Table:
    > 0.0.0.0/0 means all IP Addresses

Flexibility of Longest Matching Prefix:
    > can provide default behavior with less specific prefixed
    > can special case behavior, with more specific prefixes.

Performance of Longest Matching Prefix:
    > Uses hierarchy for a compact table
        -> Benefits from less specific prefixed
    > Lookup is more complex than table
        -> was a concern for fast router, but not an issue in practice 
           these days

Other aspects:
    > Decrement time to live
    > check header checksum
    > Fragment large packets
    > Send congestion signals
    > generate error messages
    > Handle various options
