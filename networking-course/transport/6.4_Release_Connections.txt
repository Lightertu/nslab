Connection Release:
    > Orderly Release by both parties when done
        -> Delivers all pending data and "hangs up"
        -> Cleans up state in sender and receiver

    > Key problem is to provide reliability while releasing
        -> TCP uses a "symmetric" close in which both sides shutdown independently


TIME_WAIT State
    > We wait a long time after sending all segments and before completing the close

Why
    > ACK might have been lost, in which case FIN will be resent for an orderly close
    > Could otherwise:wq
