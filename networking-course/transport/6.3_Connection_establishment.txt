How to setup connections?

Connection Establishment
    > It is process of synchronization
    > Both sender and receiver much be ready before we start the transfer of data
        -> needs to agree on a set pf parameters
        -> Maximum segment size
    > this is signalign

Three Way Handshake:
    > Used in TCP; opens connection for data in both directions
    > Seach side probes the other with a fresh initial sequence number
        -> sends on a SYNchronize segment
        -> Echo on an ACKnowledge segment
    > Chosen to be robust even against delayed duplicates
    > Three Steps:
        -> Client sends SYN
        -> Server replies with SYN
        -> Client replies with ACK
        -> SYNs are retransmitted if lost
    > Sequence and ack number carried on further segments

    > Suppose delayed, duplicate copies of the SYN and ACK
      arrive at the server
