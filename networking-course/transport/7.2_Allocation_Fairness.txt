Efficiency vs. Fairness
    > cannot always have both
    > avoid starvation 

Generalizing "Equal per Flow"
    > Bottleneck for a flow of traffic is the link that limits its bandwidth
        -> where congestion occurs for the flow

Max-Min Fairness
    > intuitively, flows bottlenecked on a link get an equal share of that link
    > Max-min fair allocation is one that:
        -> Increasing the rate of one flow will decrease the rate of a smaller flow
        -> This "maximizes the minimum" flow
    > to find it given a network imagine "pouring water into the network"
        -> start with all flows at rate 0
        -> increase the flows until there is a new Bottleneck in the network
        -> hold fixed the rate of the flow that are bottlenecked 
        -> go to step 2 for any remaining flows
