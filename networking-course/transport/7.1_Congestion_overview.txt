Congestion is like a traffic jam

Nature of Congestion
    > Routers have internel buffer for contention
    > queues help by absorbing bursts when input > output rate
    > but if input > output all the time queue will overflow
        -> This is congestion
    > Congestion is functionof traffic pattern

Bandwidth Allocation:
    > important task for network is to allocate its capacity to sender
    > Efficient means most capacity is used but there is no congestion
    > Fair means every sender gets a resonable share the network.

    > Key observation:
        -> in an effective solution, transport and network layers much work together
    > Network layer witness congestion
        -> only it can provide direct feedback
    > Transport layer caouses congestion
        -> Only it can reduce offered load
