Transport layer uses the network:

It is a layer where we don't depend on devices anymore
    > Segments carry application data across the network

Transport layer Services
    > Provide different kinds of data delivery across the network to applications
    > UDP (unreliable, Datagrams)
    > TCP (reliable, Streams)

Comparison of Internet Transports
    > TCP is full-featured, UDP is a glorified packet

Socket API
    > the "network" API are used to write all internet apps
    > Supports both internet transport services (streams and datagrams)
    > sockets let apps attach to the local network at different ports
    > Streams:
        -> Listen
        -> Accept
        -> Connect
    > Datagram:
        -> Send (To)
        -> Receive (From)

Ports: 
    > Application process is identified by the tuple IP address, protocol, and port
        -> Ports are 16-bit integers representing local "local mailboxes" that process leases
    > Servers often bind to "well known ports"
        -> blow 1024
    > Client often assigned "ephemeral" ports
