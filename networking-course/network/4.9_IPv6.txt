Internet is growing really fast but we are only using 32 bits address

IP version 6
    > 128 bits address
    > Many sundry improvments
    > source address 
    > destinational addresses
    > flow label to gourp packets

Became an IETF standard in 1008
    > Hampered by deployment issues
    > Big push ~2011 as exhaustion looms


IPv6 Transition
    > Big problem
        -> how to deploy IPv6
        -> incompatible with IPv4

    > Dozen of approaches propose
        -> Dual stack(IPv4 and IPv6)
        -> Translators
        -> Tunnels (carry IPv6 over IPv4)

Tunneling:
    > using IPv4 to send IPv6 as a payload
    > effective
