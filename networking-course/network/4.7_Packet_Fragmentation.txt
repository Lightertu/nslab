Packet size Problems:
    > different networks have different packet sizes

Prefer large packets for efficiency
    > What size is too large?
    > Difficult because node does not know newwork path

Packet Size Solutions:
    > Fragmentation (now)
    > Discovery (next)

IPv4 Fragmentation:
    > Fragmentation happens at router, reassembling happens at host

IPv4 Fragmentation Fields
    > Identification
    > Total Length field
    > Fragment offset
    > control bits
    > MF (More Fragments)

IPv4 Fragmentation Procedure
    > Router splits a packet that is too large
        -> Break into large pieces
        -> Copy IP header to pieces
        -> Adjust the length
        -> Set offset to indicate position
        -> Set MF on all pieces except last

Receiving host reassembles the pieces:
    > Identification and MF flag are used

Path MTU Discovery:
    > Discover the MTU that will fit
    > Host tests path with large packet
    > Path MTU depends on the path and so can change over time
    > Implemented with ICMP 
        -> set DF
