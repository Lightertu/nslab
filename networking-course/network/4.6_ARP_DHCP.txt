DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration)
    > leases IP address to nodes
    > a client-server application

DHCP Addressing:
    > Bootstrap Issue:
        -> when a node wakes up what it asks
    > Answer:
        -> node sends broadcast messages that delivered to all nodes on
           the network
        -> broadcast address is all 1s 

DHCP Messages

    > being offered
    > Request
    > being sent ACK bac
    > renew
        -> request, then get ACK
    > Protocols supports replicated DHCP servers

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
    > this protocol and use to aquire Destination Ethernet address
    > sits on top of link layer
    > ask node with target IP to identify itself
    > Use broadcast to reach all nodes

Both ARPand DHCP has Discovery Protocols
    > Often involve broadcast
