What to do when there is something goes wrong during forwarding.

Internet Control Message Protcol (ICMP)
    > ICMP is implemented together with IP
    > Provides error report and testing
        -> Error is at router while forwarding

ICMP Message format
    > header, type, code, checksum
    > the start of the offending packet
    > each message is carried in an IP packet
  
Traceroute
    > IP header contains Time to Live field
    > Protects against forwarding loops
