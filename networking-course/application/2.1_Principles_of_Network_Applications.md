## 2.1.1 Networking Application Architecture

#### Client-Server 
* Clients do not directly contact each other
* Server has a fixed well known IP address
* **Data Center** are used to create virtual servers that can handle huge
  amount of traffic.

#### P2P (Peer to Peer)
* In P2P network, each nodes can talk to each other without a central server
* **Self-Scalability** is the most compelling features of P2P


## 2.1.2 Process Communicating
#### Client and Server Process
* The process that initializes the connection is **client**. The process awaits
  to be connected is the **server**.
* The web browser initializes contact with a Web Server process.
* In P2P network, a node can either be a client or a server.

#### Interface Between Process and Computer Network
* Processes send/receive through an interface called **socket**.
* Control developer has on the transportation layer
    1. Choice of transport protocol
    2. transport layer parameters (buffer size, segment size)

#### Addressing Process
* Identifying receiving process
    1. Address of the receiver
    2. A port number to verify the destination

## 2.1.3 Transport Services Available to Applications
#### Reliable Data Transfer
* If a protocol guarantees the reliable data delivery.

#### Throughput
* **Throughput** is the bits/sec of deliverying
* Transport layer can provide a service which allow application to request a guaranteed throughput.

#### Timing
* Transport layer can also provide timing guarantees.

#### Security
* Transport layer can also provide more security services 
    * Encryption/Decryption
    * Data Integrity
    * End-point authentication
