## Goal:
* plug in and play
* real time firmware updates

## [Threats in Different Levels](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/internet-things-iot-security-challenges-possible-josé-cardoso)

* Sensor Nodes Layer
    - Node Capture
        - capturing keynodes    
    - Fake Node and Malicious Data
        - injecting fake nodes to the network
    - Denial of Service Attack
    - Timing Attack
        - analyzing the time required for executing encryption algorithm
          to obtain key information
    - Routing Threads
        - Using routing algorithm to against itself
    - Replay Attack
        - attacker resends a package has been received by the destination host
          to gain authentication
    - Side Channel Attack (SCS)
        - attacls encryption devices

* Network Layer
    - Traditional Security Problems
        - illegal access networks
        - eavesdropping information
        - confidentiality damage
        - integrity damage
        - DoS attack
        - Man in the middle attack
        - virus invasion exploit attacks

    - Compatibility Problems
        - Heterogenity of devices
    - The cluster Security Problems
        - network congestion
        - DoS Attack
        - Authentication problem
        - Existing IP technology deos not apply to a large number of node
          identification.
        
    - Privacy Disclosure

* Application Layer
    - Data Access permission, ID Authentication
    - Data Protection and Recovery
    - Ability of Dealing with Mass-data
        - once the data processing ability and the adaptive ability cannot meet
          requirements, it will lead to network interruption and data loss.
    - Software vulnerabilities
        - eg. buffer overflow
