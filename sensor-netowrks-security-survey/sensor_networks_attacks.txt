Questions:
    What is in-network aggregation?

    What is link layer security?
        The link-layer commonly referred to as the data link layer, is the physical interface between the host system
        and the network hardware. It defines how data packets are to be formatted for transmission and routings. The data
        link layer and its associated protocol govern the physical interface between the host computer and the network hardware.
        the goal of this layer is to provide reliable communications between hosts connected on a network.

    What is routing protocol?
    What is an end-to-end security mechanism?
    What is crippling attack?
    What is the "Hidden terminal problem"?
        The hidden node problem occurs when a node is visible form a wireless access point, but not form other nodes communicating
        with that AP. This leads to difficulties in MAC sublayer.
    What is the MAC (Media Access Control) layer?
        The MAC layer is the lower sublayer of the data link layer of seven-layer OSI model. It provides addressing and channel
        access control mechanism that make it possible for seversal terminals or network nodes to communicate within a multiple
        access network that incorporates a shared medium.
Why:
    Current routing protocols in sensor networks are not design with security as a goal
    insecure sensor networks wireless communication can be attacked by powerful laptops with
    high energy and long range communication.

Challenges:
    In-network aggregation complicates the design of a secure routing protocol.
    

Base station: is a gate way to other networks. A powerful data processing and storage center.
Aggregation point: is a chosen sensor node which collects sensor readings from surrounding nodes
                   and then forward a message contains information from multiple nodes. It can be
                   chosen dramatically.

It is crucial to keep the radio in sleep mode the overwhelming majority of the time. To keep the power consumption down

Sensor network is different from distributed systems. In sensor network, each node has limited 
computing power, then we cannot use public key is expensive.
    > 4k memory must be handled carefully.
    > communication brandwidth is extremely dear, each bit transmitted consumes about as much power
      as executing 800-1000 instructions.
Therefore it must be designed with power in mind.


Sensor networks vs. ad-hoc wireless networks
    > sensor networks are different:
        -> Many to one: multiple sensor nodes send senor readings to a base
           station or aggregation point ion the network.
        -> One-to-many: a single node (base station) multi-casts or floods a query or control
           information to several sensor nodes.
        -> Local communication: Neighboring nodes send localized messages to discover and coordinate
           with each other. 
        -> after a sensor node is deployed it is expected to function for a long time without being maintained.
    > node in sensor network exhibits trust relationship.
        -> In order to save energy, sensor networks require in-network processing aggregation and duplicate elimination.
           this often necessitates trust relationships

Sensor networks use wireless communications, then we assume the radio links are not secure. 
    > Attackers can eavesdrop on our radio transmissions, inject bits in the channel, and replay the previously overheard packets.
    > They can also deploy some malicious nodes or turning legit node into malicious nodes
    > nodes are not tamper resistant. Tamper resistance add per-unit cost.
    > MAC layer:
        -> jam radio links by transmitting without stop or try to cause collisions by leveraging the "hidden terminal" problem.
        -> for CTS/RTS frames adversaries can send frequent CTS frames with long duration fields, so other nodes cannot use the
           channel.
        -> MAC protocols using randomized backoff are susceptible to attack, if nodes have predictable pseduo-random number
               generation. Adversaries are able to predict backoff times can cause long backoff times or collision.

Threat Models 
    > Model class attacker 
        -> attackers have access to a few sensor nodes with similar capabilities to our own.
    > laptop class attacker
        -> attackers have access to powerful devices. 
        -> therefore malicious nodes  are more powerful
    > outside attacker
    > inside  attacker

Security goals:
    > Confidentiality
    > Integrity
    > Authenticity
    > Availability of all messages in the presence of resourceful adversaries.
    > Every receiver should receive all messages intended for it and be able to verify the integrity of every message as well
      as the identity of the sender.
    > Adversaries should not be able to infer the content of any messages.Confidentiality
    > Protection against the replay of data packets


In sensor networks the traffic pattern is many to one, with many sensor node needing to communicate sensor readings or network
events back to a central base station

    for outside attacker
        > link layer security can guarantee integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality. 
        > we rely on routing protocol to guarantee availability

    for inside attacker
        > link layer security is not enough

Attacks on sensor network routing: 
    > Spoofed, altered, or replayed routing information
        -> target the routing information exchanged between nodes
        -> create routing loops, attack or repel networking traffic.
        -> extend or shorten routes
        -> generate false error messages
        -> partition the network
        -> increase the end-to-end latency

    > selective forwarding
        -> malicious nodes refuse to forward certain messages and drop them.
        -> if an adversary is only interested in modifying packets, but reliably forward
           the remaining packets, can limit the suspicion of her wrongdoing.
        -> most effective when the attacker is explicitly included on the path of a data flow.
        -> adversary will follow the path of least resistance and attempt to include herself
           on the actual path of the data flow.

    > Sinkhole attacks
        -> lure all the traffic from an area through a compromised node
        -> sinkhole attack can enable many other attacks. especially makes selective forwarding trivial 
        -> sensor networks are vulnerable to sinkhole because they all share the same ultimate destination.
        -> a compromised node needs only to provide a single high-quality route to the base station in
           order to influence a potentially large number of nodes.

    > Sybil attacks
        -> a single node presents multiple identities to other nodes in the network
        -> can reduce the effectiveness of fault-tolerant schemes.
        -> pose a threat to geographic routing protocols by being in more than one place
           at once.

    > Warm-holes
        -> an adversary tunnels messages received in one part of the network over a low-latency link
           and replays them in a different part. 
        -> having a malicious node sitting between two normal nodes and forward messages between them
        -> A well located wormhole node close to a base station can completely disrupt routing
        -> it can create sinkhole by convincing other nodes that there is a short route.
        -> use to exploit routing race conditions.
        -> likely to be used in combination with selective forwarding or eavesdropping
        -> detection is hard when used in conjunction with the Sybil attack
    > HELLO flood attacks
        -> a laptop class attacker with large transmission power can convince every node in the network could
           convince every node that the attack is their neighbor.
    > acknowledgement spoofing.
        -> adversary can spoof link layer acknowledgments for "overhead" packets addressed to neighboring nodes
        -> can convince the sender that a weak link is strong and a dead or disabled node is alive.
        -> can be used combined with selective forwarding

Attacks on specific sensor network protocols
    > TinyOS beaconing
        -> since the routing updates are not authenticated, it is possible for any node to claim to be a base
           station and become the destination of all traffic in the network
    > Directed diffusion
        -> It is a data-centric routing algorithm for drawing information out of a sensor network.
            --> base station flows interests for named data.
            --> nodes has what dase station wants sends back the data.
        -> attack has following goals:
            --> suppression
            --> cloning, make it self a base station
            --> Path influence
    > Geographic routing
        -> route each packet to the neighbor closest to the destination.
            --> Path influence
        -> location information can be misrepresented. 
        -> adversary maximize her chances for placing herself on the path of any nearby data.
        ->
