## What do we care?
* Support heterogeneity of devices
    - Especially for power constrained devices
* flexibility
    - building blocks can be replaced by customized ones
    - Open source
* Easy to configure
* Easy to scale
* Authority 
    - good developers rep
* popularity 
    - good tutorials 
* platform independent for research
    - the diffculty of platform migration

## From Key Feature:
* supporting herterogenous sensors
    - Pool of standardized communication protocols availible for choose
    - offers hardware or firmware for implementing a gateway for passive devices
    - support of protocols for constrained devices (MQTT, CoAP)

* Data procesing and sharing for supporting new services
    - Majority uses access key
    - Support for processing and sharing the data steams
    - Fault management of data streams for IoT platform

* Support of application developers
    - REST APIs
    - Different programming language 
    - SDKs for developping applications

* provisions for handling and processing data locally
* uniform data models, data catalogs and edge analytics capabilities
    
* ~~The completeness of and IoT ecosystem~~
* ~~security and privacy~~

## A Good IoT Platform should have
8 Offering streamline APIs


## A list of Open Source IoT Platforms
* [Lelylan](http://www.lelylan.com/)
    - Incomplete Documentation
* **[Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/)**
    - More for small scale IoT 
* **[Thing Speak](https://thingspeak.com/)**
    - Very friendly to use by there is no support for different protocols
* [Bug Labs](http://buglabs.net/)
    - Cannot find documentation
* **[The Thing System](http://thethingsystem.com/)**
    - very good support for commercial IoT hardware
    - Designed for easy of use, but show no sign of flexibility
* [Open Remote](http://www.openremote.com/)
    - More of a Platform as service model, show no sign of flexibility
* **[Zetta](http://www.zettajs.org/)**
    - Easy to implement
    - Good amount of user base
    - Many modules are availible.
    - Node.js has a steep learning curve
    - Not too flexible.

* **[Kaa](http://www.kaaproject.org/)**
    - Support all the key features
    - Designed for a large scale system
    - Different programming languages to choose from
    - Protocol pool
    - Transport layer protocol can be customized
    - contains device dependent SDK in C, can run without operating system.
    - Gateway implemetation support


## Matrice
* Ease to include attackers
* least efforts to success
