## From developers:
    - supporting herterogenous sensors
        - Pool of standardized communication protocols availible for choose
        - offers hardware or firmware for implementing a gateway for passive devices
        - support of protocols for constrained devices (MQTT, CoAP)
        - support of traditional web protocols for powerful devices

    - security and privacy
        - Majority uses access key

    - Data procesiing and sharing for supporting new services
        - Majority uses access key
        - Support for processing and sharing the data steams
        - Fault management of data streams for IoT platform

    - Support of application developers
        - REST APIs
        - Different programming language 
        - SDKs for developping applications

    - The completeness of and IoT ecosystem
        - plateform shall attract the developers of add-ons and application

    
## A Good IoT Platform should have
    - Standard communication protocols to interface herterogenous devices
    - provisions for handling and processing data locally
    - uniform data models, data catalogs and edge analytics capabilities
    - Offering streamline APIs
