    This article mainly introduces two architectures / frameworks that are trying to standardize the world
of internet of things. At the end of this article, it introduces a security framework respects to one of 
the frameworks. Also this text takes a lot of efforts elaborating the importance of internet of things, but 
those will not appear in this review. Since both of us understands the significance of IoTs.

    There are tree reasons of why having an IoT architecture can be beneficial.   
        > It offers network manager a view of completeness and a checklist of evaluation of the functionalities.
        > It provides guidance to developers as to which functions are needed in an IoT network and how they work
          together.
        > It can serve as a framework of standardization.

    The first framework, ITU-T IoT Reference Model, is developed by ITU-T (Telecommunication Standardization Sector 
of the International Telecommunication Union). It goes into details of physical components of the IoT ecosystem. An 
important note to this model is that "the IoT is in fact not a network of physical things, rather it is a network 
that drives physical things, together with application platforms." But before understanding this model, we need to 
look at how this model defines each component.

        > Communication Network: infrastructure network connects devices and apps.

        > Thing: an object that is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks.

        > Device: an equipment with mandatory capability of communication and optional capabilities of sensing data.
            -> Data-capturing Device: A reader or writer that interacts with physical things, interaction happens indirectly 
               via data carrying devices. 
          +-
          | -> Data-carrying Device: A device attached to a physical things to indirectly connect to the physical thing,
          |    like a RFID tags.
          |
          | -> Data carrier: Battery free data carrying objects attach to a physical thing can provide information to a 
          |    suitable data capturing device. Like QR code or bar code.
          |
          |    Note* Data-carrying device and data carrier devices are different in this model. The former has as the
          |          capability of communication, but the latter is just like a physical tag, say QR code
          +-

        > Sensors

        > Actuating device: A device converts digital electronic signals from the information networks into operations
        
        > General Device: A device has embedded processing unit and communication capabilities, like smartphones, or base station.
        
        > Gateway: A unit in the IoT that interconnects the device with the communication networks as a protocol translator
            -> It supports a variety of device access technologies (protocol translation).
            -> It supports necessary networking technologies for both local and wide-area networking (protocol translation).
            -> It supports interaction with applications providining higher-level functionality on behalf of IoT devices.

        Also radio frequency, infrared, optical, and galvanic driving are used for interaction between data capturing device 
        and data-carrying device, 
        
        * "An example is implanted medical devices that use the conductive properties of the body. In implant-to-surface 
          communication, galvanic coupling sends signals from an implanted device to electrodes on the skin. This scheme uses 
          very little power and reduces the size and complexity of the implanted device."
        
        Below is a general view of all the components together.

        Below is a technical overview of the ITU-T IoT system.
        
        TODO: insert figure 3

    This model also illustrates three possibilities of communication among devices:
        > communication via gateway
        > using communication network without the gateway
        > communicate directly with each other through a local network (sensor network)

        Below is a figure of networking layers, very similar to OSI layers

        TODO: insert figure 4

    In this model there are 4 General layers, along with a security layer.
        > Application layer: all apps interacts with IoT devices.
        > Service Support and Application Support layer: provides capabilities that applications use
        > Network layer: 
            -> networking capabilities: interconnection of devices and gateways
            -> transport capabilities:  correspond to OSI network transport layers
        > device layer

    The Security Capabilities Layer includes generic security capabilities that are independent of applications.
        > Application Layer: 
            -> authorization 
            -> authentication 
            -> application 
            -> data confidentiality 
            -> integrity 
            -> protection 
            -> privacy protection
            -> security 
            -> anti-virus.

        > Network Layer: 
            -> authorization 
            -> authentication 
            -> user data
            -> confidentiality 
            -> signaling 
            -> integrity protection.

        > Device Layer: 
            -> authentication 
            -> authorization 
            -> device integrity 
            -> validation 
            -> access control
            -> data confidentiality and integrity 
            -> protection

   The second framework IoT World Form Reference Model, in the latter text we refer it as IWF. This model 
is developed by IoT World Forum. If ITU-T focuses on device level, then this one is emphasized on an overall 
big picture. According to Cisco, the party contributed to developing this model, IWF has the following 
characteristics.

    > Simplifies each complex part of the system.
    > Clarifies common terminology
    > Identifies types of processing are to be optimized
    > Standardizes IoT products that work with each other

It contains seven different levels (from top down) 
    > Level 1: Physical devices (Sensors, devices)
        -> Enables devices to communicate with each other some time via upper logic level (Such as smartphones and 
           other remote control devices).
        
    > Level 2: Connectivity (Communication and Processing Units)
        -> In this level the gateway in ITU-T is placed here.
        -> It is desirable to do as much processing close to the sensors as possible.
        -> Data preprocessing, thus the burden of higher level processing unit can be shared.
            * Evaluation: see if the data should be processed to higher level.
            * Formatting data.
            * Expanding / decoding: handling encrypted data.
            * Reduction: summarizing data to minimize the impact of data and traffic on the network and higher-level 
              processing systems.
            * Assessment: redirecting data to additional destinations.

    > Level 3: fog computing (流水线processing)
        -> Distinguished characteristic of IoT from cloud computing.
        -> Massive numbers of individual smart objects are interconnected with fog network facilities that provides 
           processing and storage resources close to the edge devices in an IoT.
        -> Fog computing addresses the challenges raised by the activity of thousands or millions of smart devices, 
           including security, privacy, network-capacity constraints, and latency requirements.

    > Level 4: Data accumulation level
        -> Place data coming from fog computing devices in storage for higher levels.
        -> Application can only process data at rest, not data in motion.
        -> Data stored are not application specific.
        -> Operations
            * Convert data in motion to data at rest.
            * Convert format from network packets to database.
            * Achieves transition from event based to query based computing.
            * Dramatically reduces data through filtering and selective storing.
        -> A boundary between Informational Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT).  
    > Level 5: Data abstraction
        -> formats data that makes easy for application to access
        -> Tasks including:
            * Combining data from difference sources.
            * Conversion.
            * Put formatted data in a application specific data base.
            * Alerting higher-level application the data storage is full.
            * Consolidating data into one place.
            * Data protection.
            * Indexing data for fast application access.

    > Level 6: Application level
        -> Interacts with level 5 and data at rest.
    > Level 7: Collaboration and processes level
        -> multiple application, exchange of data and control information across the Internet

    The diagram below shows the layer out all the layers.

    TODO: Figure 5

    At the end of this paper, it introduces a security framework developed by Cisco respects to the IWF model
in the previous section. However the IWF model used in the security framework is simplified to contain only
4 levels, they are 
    > Smart Object
        -> "This part of an IoT is the most vulnerable part. The devices may not be in a physically secure 
           environment and may need to function for years. Availability is certainly of concern. Also network 
           managers need to be concerned about the authenticity and integrity of the data generated by sensors 
           and about protecting actuators and other smart devices from unauthorized use. Privacy and
           protection from eavesdropping may also be requirements."

    > Fog Network
        -> "This level is concerned with the wired and wireless interconnection of IoT devices. In addition, a certain 
           amount of data processing and consolidation may be done at this level. A key concern is the wide 
           variety of network technologies and protocols that the various IoT devices use and the need to 
           develop and enforce a uniform security policy."

    > Core Network
        -> "The core network level provides data paths between network center platforms and the IoT devices. The security 
           issues here are those confronted in traditional core networks. However, the vast number of endpoints 
           to interact with and manage creates a substantial security burden."

    > Data Center
        -> "This level contains the application, data storage, and network management platforms. IoT does not introduce 
           any new security issues at this level, other than the necessity of dealing with huge numbers of individual 
           endpoints."

    Given these 4 layers, Cisco defines security capabilities across multiple layers. (See figure 7)

    > Role-Based Security: 
        -> Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems assigns access rights to roles instead of individual users. 
           In turn, users are assigned to different roles, either statically or dynamically.

    > Anti-tamper and Detection: 
        -> Across device and fog network levels but also extends to the core network level. All of these levels may 
           involve components that are physically outside the area of the enterprise that is protected by physical 
           security measures.

    > Data Protection and Confidentiality: These functions extend to all levels of the architecture.

    > Internet Protocol Protection: Protection of data in motion from eavesdropping and snooping is essential 
      between all levels.
        
   Now we know the security capabilities of each level, however, we also needs to know each components of a 
   security facility that across multiple levels. In total, there are 4 components for each facility.
        -> Authentication
            * identifying the IoT devices without human interaction, such as RFID, MAC address of the endpoint

        -> Authorization
            * establishes the necessary parameters to enable the exchange of information between devices and 
              between devices and application platforms

        -> Network Enforced Policy
            * All elements that route or transport endpoint traffic

        -> Security Analytics, including Visibility and Control
            * central management of IoT devices
            * securely aware of all the existence of distributed IoT devices
            * control, configure, and update them.


    To conclude, IoT is the future, however, there is no standard framework to regulate the IoT world yet, but
many organizations and people are trying to define it. Security is a huge problem comes with IoT, there are a
decent among of questions need to be answered, thus it is worthy researching for IoT security solutions.
