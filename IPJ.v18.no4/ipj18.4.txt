Pervasive Computing (Ubiquitous Computing): embedding microprocessors in everyday objects so they can communicate infomation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why internet of things?
-----------------------
Net profit for internet economy in next decade is $14.4 trillion.

Five main drivers of IoT economy:
    > Asset use: Iot reduces selling and administrative expense and 
      cost of goods by improving business process execution and capital
      efficiency.
    > Employee productivity: more productive man-hours.
    > Supply chain: eliminating waste and improving process efficiencies
    > Customer experience: creating customer life-time value and grows 
      market share by adding more customers.
    > Innovation (less effort on marketing): increase return on R&D
      investments, reduces time to market, creates additional revenue 
      streams from new business models and opportunities.

Scope of IoTs
-------------
ITU-T gives the following definitions
    > IoT:
    > Things: object capable of being identified na dintegrated into
      communication networks
    > Device: mandatory capability of communication and optional
      capabilities of sensing, actuation, data capture, data storage,
      and data processing.

Other Definitions:
    > contains a micro-controller to provide intellgence.
    > contains sensor(s)
    > Provide means of communication 
    > be able to identified (id tag)

Challenges:
    > energy resource constrain
    > frequent data exchange over loss networks
    > existing internet protocols are not optimal in this case
    > mis-match between data generating rate and few data storage
      locations with slow data update rate.

Two efforts developing overall frameworks

IoT World Forum Reference Model
===============================
It focuses on device and gateway level with only a broad description of upper layers, it is mostly concerned with the broader issue
of developing the applications, middleware, and support functions for an enterprise based IoT.

It has the following characteristics:
    > Simplifies: breaks down the complex system
    > Clarifies: precisely identify levels of the IoT.
    > Identifies: id which type of processing is optimized
    > Standardized: common interface and industrial standards
    > Organize: makes IoT approachable

Seven Levels:
    > Level 1: Physical devices (Sensors, devices)
        -> Enables devices to communicate with each other some time via uppper logic level (Such as smartphones and other remote control devices)
        
    > Level 2: Connectivity (Communication and Processing Units)
        -> in this level the gateway in ITU-T is placed here
        -> It is desirable to do as much processing close to the sensors as possible
        -> data preprocessing, thus the burden of higher level processing unit can be shared
            * Evaluation: see if the data should be processed to higher level
            * Formatting
            * Expanding / decoding: handling crptic data

        -> Fog computing addresses the challenges raised by the activity of thousands or millions of smart devices, including security, privacy, 
           network-capacity constraints, and latency requirements.

    > Level 4: Data accumulation level

        -> a boundary between Informational Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) 

    > Level 5: Data abstraction
        -> formats data that makes easy for application to access
        -> Tasks including:
            * Combining data from difference sources
