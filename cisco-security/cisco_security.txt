IoT system is a distributed intelligence system
    > Data collection:
        -> centralized data collection and smart object management does not
           provide the scalability required by the Internet.
    > Network Resource Preservation:
        -> branchwidth is limited, and collecting environmental data from a 
           central point leads to using a large amount of network capacity.
    > Close loop functiioning:
        -> sending to centralized system before sending an order to an actuator
           is slow.

 
 Fog computing is ideal for IoT.

 Brains of IoT:
    > Service Management System
    > Network Management System
    > backend System

Growth of IoT:
    > Shifting from consumer based IPv4 (Information Technology) to 
      IPv6 Operational Technology, Machine to Machine interactions.
    > main drivers contribute to the growth of IoT
        -> Ubiquitous Computing
        -> Ubiquitous use of IP
        -> Ubiquitous Connectivity

IoT Protocols:
    Protocols have been designed with energy preservation in mind, along with
    low computing and memory requirements.

    IPv6 is the major enabler of IoT, therefore security considerations and 
    implications of IPv6 are funcamental to securing the IoT

Security Challenges:
    > inexpensive devices with no physical security
    > low computing power devices may not support complex and evolving security
      algorithms
    > No backup connectivity
    > Mostly installed prior to network availability which increases the overall on-boarding time
    > Requires secure remote management during and after onboarding
    > Scalability and management of billions of entities in the IoT ecosystem
    > identification of endpoints in a scalable manner
        -> individual 
        -> group
        -> scalability
        -> scalability challenges of individual vs group
        -> Sometimes the location may be more important than the individual identifier (ID)
    > Management of Multi-party Networks 
        -> who has provisioning access?
        -> who accepts liability
    > Crypto Resilience
        -> smart meters could last beyond 40 years, which is longer than its algorithm lifetime
    > Physical Protection
    > Tamper detection techniques and design


Each IoT devices can have multiple ownership, device will be required to have equal and
open access to a number of data consumers and controllers concurrently, while still
retaining and exclusivity of data. Thus we must establish identity control and trust
relationships between entities to share the right information.

There are complex security requirements to be deployed with potentially limited resources
    > Authenticate to multiple networks securely
    > Ensure that data is available to multiple collectors
    > Manage the contention between that data access
    > Manage privacy concerns between multiplle consumers
    > Provide strong authentication and data protection
    > maintain availability of data or the service
    > allow for evolution in the face of unknown risks

Different layers
    > Embedded System
        -> authenticity of data must be ensured, the path from sensor to the collector
           cannot be compromised
    > Multi-service Edge Layer
        -> must support different protocols to accommodate a variety of endpoints
        -> many endpoints use insecure protocols

Core Network Layer
    > Security services protects the system from the following threat:
        -> Man in the middle 
        -> Impersonation
        -> Confidentiality compromise
        -> Replay attack

Data Center Cloud Layer
    > The following attack can happen
        -> Denial of Service
            * making a resource unavailable (Radio jammer can carry out the attack)
        -> endpoint exploitation

IoT Threads:
    Comparing to traditional internet the attacks threat moves from manipulating to
    controlling devices, also many OS are moving from closed system to IP based 
    system, therefore attack surfaces are expanded.
    
    can be affected by the following
        > worms jumping
        > Script kiddies
        > organized crime 
        > Cyber terrorism

Security in IoT/M2M
    > mechaisms to authenticate device identity needs to be re-engineered to suit IoT's
      low computing power nature
    > New authentication schemes needs to be built

Privacy
    > Many applications generate traceable signatures of location and behavior of
      individuals
