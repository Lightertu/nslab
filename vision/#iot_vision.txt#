. Introduction
---------------
    IoT definition:
        > The resulting global network interconnecting smart objects by means of extended Internet technologies.
        > The set of supporting technologies necessary to realize such a vision.
        > The ensemble of applications and services leveraging such technologies to open new business and market
          oppotunities.

    Research Satuation:
        > The IoT research community is fragmented, folks are focusing on specific applications and technology, but the
          networking and communication scientific communities are limited. This is potentially harmful 

    Smart Objects:
        > Unique identifier
        > Unique address
        > Communication capabilities
        > Processing capabilities
    
    Characteristics:
        > Anything communicates
        > Anything is identified
        > Anything interacts

2. Vision and Concept
---------------
    System Level Perspective:
        > may not have a full protocol stack
        > may not apply end-to-end principle
        > Computation is done through fog computing, not cloud
        > scalability is a challenge, how 
        > high level of dynamism in the network, devices can move and create
          hoc connections with nearby ones. Self-management and automatic
          capabilities are required.

    Service Level Perspective:
        > how to create service out of the devices, the whole eco-system needs to be
          standardize to allow seamless composition between smart objects

    User point of view:
        > new always responsive services
        > shifting from always on service to always responsive service. Rather than having people to look
          for information online, IoT can actually provide more service to handle execution details in 
          people's daily life.
        > IoT will build on existing technology such as sensor networks and service-oriented architectures.

    IoT System level features:
        > Device heterogeneity
            -> The management of such a high level of heterogeneity shall be supported at both architectural 
               and protocol level.
        > Scalability
            -> naming and addressing (small system)
            -> data communication and networking (high level of interconnection)
            -> information and knowledge management
            -> service management (large number of services)
            -> Ubiquitous wireless communication (spectrum availibility)
            -> Energy-optimized solutions
            -> Localization and tracking capabilities (know where each object is)
            -> Self organization capabilities (nodes need to automatically organize themselves to serve under
               different situation)
        > Semantic interoperability and data management
            -> providing data with standardized format and semantic description of the content.
        > Embedded Security and privacy-preserving mechanisms
            -> Security mechanism should be designed along with the architecture


3. Research Context
-------------------
    Here we look at the relevant research field which will assist the development of IoTs.
        
    > 3 limiting factor of self-organization capability
        -> support of heterogeneous devices, 
            * unlike sensor network where each sensor process data with common characteristics. 
              Also, we need to put less unnecessary burden on the device, such as a full 
              protocol stack
        -> Energy efficiency, 
        -> number of electronics can be embedded in an IoT object. (we might need more than what
           we can do by far)

    > RFID
        -> Its usage is still limited, they are primarily used in isolated and vertically integrated systems.

    > Ambient Intelligence
        -> embedding of computational devices into the environment
        -> builds upon ubiquitous computing concept
        -> have been mainly developed for "closed" environments
        -> IoT expends AmI to open scenarios
            * services can be added at run-time rather than design time

    > Standardizing heterogeneity
        -> standard virtual platform in all network devices
        -> Frameworks based on mobile agents (not very 靠谱)
    
    > IoT architecture needs to understand context
        -> Schilit's active map system
        -> self-adaptive situated service (not good enough)
        -> we need design patterns that can be used to augment end-user applications with self-adaptive properties.
            * discovering, deploying and composing services at run-time
            * supporting autonomicity within all phases of the service life-cycle.
    
    > frameworks for developing IoT applications
        -> Service-oriented computing
            * distributed architecture
            * entities can be accessed via standard interfaces
            * currently a lot of them use web-based protocols
            * current setup is too heavy weight for IoT

        -> Service-oriented architecture
            * a collection of services can communicate with each other via standardized interaction pattern
         
4. Research Challenges (Unfinished)
----------------------
    > Identification:
        can be done in two ways:
        ->  physical tag, such as RFID or QR code, require a global database of IDs
        ->  embed description unit into object, does not require global database, however
            need to embed more electronic into it.

    > Sensing:
        -> instead of being designed a single task object, we need object themselves embed meaning for
           sensing the local environments and act on it.
    
    > Computing, communication and identification technologies:
        need for an architecture supporting low-power, low-cost and yet fully networked and integrated 
        devices fully compatible with standard communication technologies.
        -> Computing:
            * low power computing
            * power saving protocol
            * power saving vs latency
            * innovated energy harvesting
        -> communication
            * in-networking
        -> ID
            * passive, RFID tag, 
            * active tag has on-board power source for on-board receiver and transmitter.




5. Security
-----------
    > Data Confidentiality
        -> access control mechanism
            * role based access control, access right can be modified dynamically
            * access control techniques should be integrated with data streams management system
                - protect during transmission
                - access control
                    B. Carminati, E. Ferrari, K. Tan, Enforcing access control policies on data streams

        -> object authentication process
            * hop-by-hop encrypted data aggregation
                - encrypted by the sensing nodes and decrypted by the aggregator nodes
                - vulnerable because the intermediate aggregator nodes are easy to tamper and the 
                  sensor readings are decrypted on those aggregators.
            * end to end encrypted data aggregation
                - intermediate aggregator does not decrypt data
                - whole network is compromised in case the key is compromised in a sensing nodes.

        -> device identity management
            * reach an agreement on the concept of identity
                - federation: a set of organizations that establish trust relationships with respect 
                  to the identity information maintained.
                    + both identity providers and service providers

            * Identity Management System
                - identity providers
                    + authentication of entities
                    + Authenticate entities using signle-sign-on (SSO) technology
                - service providers
                    + offer services to users that satisfy the policy requirements 
                    + specifies and enforces the access control policies

    > Privacy
        In fact, wireless channel increases the risk of vio- lation due to the remote access capabilities
        which potentially expose the system to eavesdropping and masking attacks

        Privacy issue needs to be considered during the system design phase.
        Challenges:
            > definition of a general model for privacy in IoT
            > Development of innovative enforcement techniques, able to support the scale and heterogeneity
              characterizing IoT scenarios
            > balances the need of anonymity presented by some applications with the localization and tracking 
               requirements of some other ones.
        

    > Trust
        Trust negotiation refers to the process of credential exchanges that allows a party requiring a service or 
        a resource from another party to provide the necessary credentials in order to obtain the ser- vice or 
        the resource.

        The ability to meet the trust requirement is indeed strictly related to the identity management and access 
        control issues

        Issues to be address for developing trust services:
            -> The globally accepted certification authorities should be addressed 
            -> A language to simplify credential specifications and to express a wide range of protection requirements
            -> idefinition of an effective model of trust should account for both the highly distributed nature of 
               the IoT as well as for the requirements.
