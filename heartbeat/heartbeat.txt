The key challenge in addressing these attacks stems from the difficulty of modifying or replacing already-implanted IMDs.
Adding cryotigraphy directly to IMDs is hard because of the following reasons
    > Inalterability  
    > Safety
        -> Every legit medical person should have immediate access to IMD
    > Maintainability
        -> Devices cannot be recalled

The Shield
    > The shield acts as a gateway between IMD and potential counter parties
    > uses cryptographic channel to communicate with authorized endpoints
    > adversarial actions it can handle
        -> passive eavesdropping (confidentiality)
            * sending out jamming signal while receiving from IMDs
        -> active unauthorized radio command transmission 
            * listens for unauthorized transmissions addressing the IMD and jams them
    > full-dupldex radio to receive and transmit the same time
        -> "In particular, state-of-the-art design for full-duplex radios exploits the 
           property that a signal reverses its phase every half a wavelength; it 
           transmits the same signal from two antennas and puts a receive antenna 
           exactly half a wavelength closer to one of the transmit antennas than 
           the other."
        -> can be prototyped using a software radio
    > additional desire feature
        -> can detect adversaries who try to alter the shield's signal to convey
           unnauthorized massages to the IMD.
        -> ensure that it stops jamming the medium when an adversarial signal ends
    
Thread Model:
    > Passive eavedropper
        It has the following properties
        -> may try different decoding strategies 
        -> may consider jamming as noise and decode during jamming
        -> may implement interference cancellation
        -> joint decoding

        However basic results in multi-user information theory show that decoding 
        multiple signals is impossible if the total information rate is outside the 
        capacity region.

        -> may use standard or custom-built equipment to seperate jamming signal
           from IMD's signal. 

        However, if shield is located less than a half wavelength from the IMD, it won't
        work

        -> adversary may be in any location farther away from IMD

    > Active Adversary
        sends unauthorized ra- dio commands to the IMD, it has the following properties:
        -> several approaches to send commands
            * generate its own unauthorized messages
            * record messages from other source and replay them
            * alter authroized messages
        -> different hardware
            * modified high transmission power commercial IMD programmer 

System Overview
    Key to the shield’s role is its ability to act as a jammer-cum-receiver, which enables 
    it to jam the IMD’s transmissions and prevent others from decoding them, while still 
    being able to decode them itself.
