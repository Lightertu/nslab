How do we connect networks with different maxium packet size

Packet size problem
    > Different networks have different maximum packet sizes
    > refer large packet for efficiency

Packet Size Solutions:
    > Fragmentation (now)
        -> router fragment packets that are two large
        -> Receiving host reassembles to reduce load on router
        -> Fragmentation Fields:
            * identification
            * Total Length
            * Fragment offset
            * some control bits (MF-> more fragments, DF-> don't fragment)
    > Discovery (Next)

Fragmentation Procedure
    > Router split a packet that is too large
        -> Typically break into large pieces
        -> Copy IP header to pieces
        -> Adjust length on pieces
        -> Set offset to indicate position 
        -> Set MF on all pieces except last

    > Receiving host reseesmbles the pieces:
        -> identification field links pieces together,
           MF tell receiver if it has all the pieces
